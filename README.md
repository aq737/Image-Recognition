The classification of Pedestrians is one of the most sought after problems while trying to create automatic signals. The problem can be solved using
Deep layer neural network already trained on Resnet network for object detection.
It is able to achieve around 80% accuracy in detecting traffice on road,
The performance varies depending upon the resolution of the image
